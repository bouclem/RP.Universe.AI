        question: "What is LettuceAI?",
        answer: (
          <p>
            LettuceAI is a chat app for AI characters. Unlike apps that route your messages
            through a single hosted service, LettuceAI lets you bring your own API key from
            providers like Mistral, Cerebras, Google AI Studio, OpenAI, Anthropic, or run
            models locally on your device. Your chats stay on your device.
          </p>

        question: "What is an API key and why do I need one? (BYOK explained)",
        answer: (
          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              BYOK means "Bring Your Own Key." Think of an API key as a personal pass
              card that lets an app talk to a service on your behalf. When you sign up
              with a provider like Mistral, Cerebras, Google AI Studio, or OpenAI, they
              give you a long string of letters and numbers. That's your key.
            </p>
            <p>
              The AI models that write the replies don't live on your phone. They run on
              big servers owned by those providers. Every message you send needs to
              travel to one of those servers, get a reply, and come back. The key tells
              the provider "this request is from me, charge it to my account."
            </p>
            <p>
              Most other AI chat apps hide this from you by running their own server in
              the middle: they hold one big key, you pay them a subscription, and your
              conversations pass through their machines. LettuceAI doesn't do that. You
              put your own key in the app, and messages go straight from your device to
              the provider you picked. Nothing in between.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's why you have to add a key once before you can chat, and also why
              the app is free, your chats stay private, and you only pay for what you
              actually use.

        question: "Is this an alternative to other AI chat apps?",
        answer: (
          <p>
            Yes. If you've used an AI chat app where everything just worked but you
            couldn't pick your model, couldn't control your data, or felt limited by a
            subscription, LettuceAI is built for that. You bring your own API key, pick
            the model you want, and your chats stay on your device. The trade-off is a
            short one-time setup; the upside is total control over cost, quality, and
            privacy.

        ),
      },
      {
        question: "How much does it cost?",
        answer: (
          <p>
            LettuceAI itself is free. You pay the model provider directly, usually a
            fraction of a cent per message. Free tiers exist on Mistral, Cerebras, and
            Google AI Studio. Heavy use of frontier models (Claude Opus 4.7, GPT-5.1,
            Gemini 3 Pro) can add up, so check the provider's pricing page before picking
            a model.

        question: "Is my API key safe?",
        answer: (
          <p>
            Your API key is stored locally on your device and only ever sent to the
            provider you configured it for. LettuceAI does not have a server that sees
            your key or your messages.

      },
      {
        question: "Where are my chats stored? Can anyone read them?",
        answer: (
          <p>
            Chats are stored locally in the app's database on your device. They are not
            uploaded anywhere. When you send a message, only that conversation's text is
            sent to your chosen provider for a reply, then their response comes back and
            is saved locally.

      {
        question: "Can my chats get deleted on their own?",
        answer: (
          <p>
            No. Chats live in a local database on your device and only you can delete
            them. They aren't synced to any LettuceAI server, so we can't wipe them, and
            no automatic cleanup runs in the background. The only ways your chats go
            away are: you delete them yourself, you uninstall the app, you reset the
            app, or your device storage is wiped.

        question: "Can someone edit my data remotely?",
        answer: (
          <p>
            No. There's no remote admin panel, no LettuceAI account, and no server with
            a copy of your characters, chats, or settings. Nobody at LettuceAI can push
            a change to your data, lock you out, or reach into the app to modify
            anything. Your data only changes when you change it on your own device.

          <p>
            Your characters and chats keep working as long as the app is on your device.
            Cloud models would stop replying if you have no key or your provider goes
            away, but everything you've created stays readable locally and exportable

        question: "Will providers train on my conversations?",
        answer: (
          <p>
            That depends on the provider's policy, not on LettuceAI. Most paid API tiers
            (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral) do not train on API traffic by default. Free
            tiers sometimes do. If this matters to you, read the privacy page of whichever
            provider you use.

            so if you hit a wall, just switch to another free provider or upgrade.

        answer: (
          <div className="space-y-3">
            <p>
              A token is roughly a small piece of a word, about 4 characters or
              three-quarters of an English word on average. "Hello there!" is around 3
              tokens. A full sentence might be 15–20.
            </p>
            <p>
              Providers charge per token, not per message. Each request counts both the
              tokens you send (your message plus the character's setup and chat history)
              and the tokens the model writes back. That's why long chats with lots of
              context cost more than short fresh ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              You don't need to count tokens yourself. The app handles it. It just
              helps to know that "1 million tokens" on a pricing page is a lot of
              chatting.

              This means either you haven't added any model to LettuceAI yet, or you

              Open Settings → Models and add a model from one of your configured

            </p>
            <p>
              Each character can use its own model, or fall back to your global default

            Cloud models (Mistral, Cerebras, OpenAI, Google) run on someone else's
            hardware, need an internet connection, and cost money per message. Local
            models run directly on your desktop computer through the built-in llama.cpp
            option, are private and offline, but need a capable PC and take more storage.
